                    <p>Hello! I'm new to the world of coding. I've spent the last 5 years working in Human Services
                        throughout Boston and the Seacoast. This is a big and exciting change for me. I like
                        creating, exploring, and eating. Any activity that involves all three is a winner for me. My
                        dream job is a role where I am able to push myself creatively in an enviornment that is
                        continually changing and challenging. I like to think and solve problems creatively, and
                        I'm looking for a shift in my career. Even in progressing through the pre-work, I'm
                        encouraged and excited to be starting this journey.
